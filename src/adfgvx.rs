//! # ADFGVX Cipher
//!
//! Implements the functionality for the ADFGVX cipher.
//!
//! The following is an excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher).
//! > In cryptography, the ADFGVX cipher was a field cipher used by the German Army on the Western
//! Front during World War I. ADFGVX was in fact an extension of an earlier cipher called ADFGX.
//!
//! > Invented by Lieutenant Fritz Nebel (1891â€“1977) and introduced in March 1918, the cipher was a
//! fractionating transposition cipher which combined a modified Polybius square with a single
//! columnar transposition.
//!
//! > The cipher is named after the six possible letters used in the ciphertext: A, D, F, G, V and
//! X. The letters were chosen deliberately because they are very different from one another in the
//! Morse code. That reduced the possibility of operator error.
