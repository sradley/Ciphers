...

3. USAGE
--------

E.g. using the Vigenere cipher.
```
use ciphers::vigenere;

// encipher
let plaintext = String::from("SOMEXAMPLETEXTHERE");
let key = String::from("EXAMPLEKEY");

let ciphertext = vigenere::cipher(plaintext, key);
println!("{}", ciphertext);

// decipher
let deciphered = vigenere::decipher(ciphertext, key);
println!("{}", deciphered);
```
